I try not to confuse "life on a.a." with life.I just can't overcome the urge to tease taunt folks who bound FAQ-lessonto a.a. with such a chip on their shoulder.  To listen to you,one might think we belonged to some church!I appreciate the patience of others who questioned your postingon a line-by-line content basis, though it's hard to know whatimpact that might have had, as compared to, say, "shovelling".Fact: If he were truly interested in ending the thread he wouldn't have postedhis last shit to be shoveled.I think I only lamented that, whatever the initial satisfactions,past a certain point circular abuse-heaping was just that.Bake Timmons, III"...there's nothing higher, stronger, more wholesome and more useful in lifethan some good memory..." -- Alyosha in Brothers Karamazov (Dostoevsky)Sincere questions:  Why are you here?
