    HFST English-analyze and English-generate installer

This package installs HFST's English-language morphological transducers and
scripts.

As root, "make install" installs system-wide scripts under /usr/local/bin and
transducers under /usr/local/share/hfst. "make uninstall" does the reverse.

After installation, the scripts
	english-analyze.sh
and
	english-generate.sh
will perform analysis and generation by attempting to run, in order,
hfst-proc, hfst-lookup and the Java utility HfstOptimizedLookup.
